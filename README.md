# bike-me-now

A simple one-page app that tells you the location of the nearest bike, or the nearest dock, in Philly's <a href="http://rideindego.com">Indego bike sharing system</a>. You can <a href="http://bike-me-now.boutell.com">try the live app here</a>.

Powered by a NodeJS API. To launch the app locally, git clone it, then:

```
cd bike-me-now
node app
```

Now you can access:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

For as long as you leave the process running.
